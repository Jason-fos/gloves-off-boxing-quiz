## Design

### Design Choices

The webpage was designed to be eye catching, informative and easy to navigate around.

### Colour
For the colour scheme bright colours were chosen to catch the users eye and draw attention
to information and links on the page. Green and blue was chosen as they are visually pleasing positive on screen colours and the light grey in the header and footer is a neutral colour that goes well with the colours on the page. 
<br>

### Fonts

Playfair+Display was used for the logo and headings as it looks good in a larger font size and is easy to read. 
<br>
Merriweather was used for the body text as it compliments the headings nicely and is highly readable on screen, both have back up font of sans-serif as its also easily readable on screen.

### Structure
The page is structured in a recognizable, user friendly and easy to learn way. on arriving to the site the user sees a logo with a navigation bar, with the links spaced out under the logo that highlight on mouse over.
The website consists of four separate pages: 
- A homepage with a section of What we do, small paragraph explaining what we do with images and links to our services page.
- An our services page consisting of images and information detailing the services provided.
